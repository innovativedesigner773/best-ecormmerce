# Cashier POS Recording Implementation

## Overview

The cashier POS system has been enhanced to record all sales transactions in the database, similar to the checkout system. This ensures that all in-store sales are properly tracked and can be used for reporting, inventory management, and business analytics.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Recording
- **Order Creation**: All POS sales are now recorded in the `orders` table using the same `OrderService` as the checkout system
- **Order Items**: Individual items are recorded in the `order_items` table with product snapshots
- **Payment Details**: Complete payment information including cashier details, amount tendered, and change given
- **Transaction Tracking**: Each sale gets a unique transaction ID for tracking

### 2. Enhanced Receipt Template
- **System Theme**: Receipt now uses the Best Brightness brand colors (#4682B4 blue theme)
- **Cashier Information**: Displays the actual cashier's name from the user profile
- **Professional Formatting**: Improved layout with proper spacing and typography
- **Order Details**: Shows order number, date, customer info (if available), and complete transaction details

### 3. Cashier Context Integration
- **User Authentication**: Uses the `useAuth` hook to get current cashier information
- **Profile Integration**: Automatically populates cashier name and details from user profile
- **Role-based Access**: Maintains security by using service role client for cashier orders

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/cashier/POS.tsx`**
   - Added `useAuth` hook integration
   - Enhanced `handleConfirmPayment` function to record sales
   - Updated receipt template with system theme and cashier info
   - Added loading states and error handling

2. **`src/utils/order-service.tsx`**
   - Added `isCashierOrder` flag to `OrderData` interface
   - Updated client selection logic to handle cashier orders
   - Enhanced logging for cashier order processing

### Database Schema

The implementation uses the existing `orders` and `order_items` tables with the following enhancements:

```sql
-- Orders table (existing)
orders (
  id, order_number, customer_id, customer_email, customer_info,
  billing_address, shipping_address, payment_method, payment_details,
  subtotal, tax_amount, shipping_amount, discount_amount, total,
  currency, notes, status, payment_status, processed_at, created_at
)

-- Order items table (existing)
order_items (
  id, order_id, product_id, product_snapshot, quantity,
  unit_price, total_price, created_at
)
```

### Payment Details Structure

For cashier orders, the `payment_details` field contains:

```json
{
  "amount_tendered": 100.00,
  "change_given": 10.00,
  "transaction_id": "POS-1234567890",
  "cashier_id": "cashier-uuid",
  "cashier_name": "John Cashier",
  "pos_location": "Store POS"
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Cashiers

2. **Scan Products**: Use barcode scanner or manual entry to add products

1. **View Sales**: All POS sales appear in the orders table
2. **Reporting**: Use order data for sales reports and analytics
3. **Inventory**: Stock levels are automatically updated

## Security Features

- **Service Role Access**: Cashier orders use service role client to bypass RLS
- **User Authentication**: Only authenticated cashiers can process sales
- **Data Validation**: All order data is validated before database insertion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## Testing

A test file has been created at `src/pages/cashier/POS.test.tsx` that validates:
- Order data structure
