# Shareable Cart Feature Implementation

## Overview

The Shareable Cart feature allows customers to generate unique, secure links for their shopping carts that can be shared with others. Recipients can view the cart contents and pay for the items directly, making it easy for friends, family, or companies to pay on behalf of the original user.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Table**: `shareable_carts`
- **Key Fields**:
  - `share_token`: Unique, secure token for sharing
  - `cart_data`: Complete cart snapshot (items, totals, promotions)
  - `cart_metadata`: Additional info (user name, message, expiration)
  - `status`: active, paid, expired, cancelled
  - `expires_at`: Automatic expiration (default 7 days)
  - `paid_by_user_id`: Who paid for the cart
  - `access_count`: Track link usage

### 2. API Services (`src/utils/shareable-cart.tsx`)
- `createShareableCart()`: Generate new shareable cart
- `getShareableCartByToken()`: Retrieve cart by token
- `markAsPaid()`: Mark cart as paid after checkout
- `getUserShareableCarts()`: Get user's shared carts
- `cancelShareableCart()`: Cancel active cart
- `extendExpiration()`: Extend cart expiration
- `generateShareableUrl()`: Create shareable URL
- `copyToClipboard()`: Copy link to clipboard
- `shareCart()`: Native share API integration

### 3. UI Components

#### ShareCartModal (`src/components/common/ShareCartModal.tsx`)
- Modal for creating shareable carts
- Cart summary display
- Personal message input
- Expiration settings (1-30 days)
- Share options (copy, native share, preview)
- Success state with generated link

#### SharedCartView (`src/pages/customer/SharedCartView.tsx`)
- Public page for viewing shared carts
- Complete checkout flow for recipients
- Multi-step process: Review → Shipping → Payment → Complete
- Order summary sidebar
- Error handling for expired/invalid carts

#### ShareableCartNotifications (`src/components/common/ShareableCartNotifications.tsx`)
- Real-time notifications for cart activities
- Notifications for: paid carts, expired carts, high access count
- Bell icon with unread count badge
- Dropdown with notification history
- Mark as read/remove functionality

### 4. Integration Points

#### CartContext Updates

- Enhanced cart state management

#### Cart Page Integration
- Added "Share Cart" button (green button below checkout)
- Integrated ShareCartModal

#### Routing

## Usage Flow

### For Cart Owner (Sharing)
1. Add items to cart
2. Click "Share Cart" button
3. Add optional personal message
4. Set expiration (1-30 days)
5. Generate shareable link
6. Copy/share link via various methods
7. Receive notifications when cart is accessed/paid

### For Recipient (Paying)
1. Click shared link
2. View cart contents and summary
3. Proceed through checkout flow:
   - Review items
   - Enter shipping information
   - Enter payment details
   - Complete payment
4. Original user receives notification

## Database Setup

Run the SQL script to set up the database:

```sql
-- Execute the contents of src/SHAREABLE_CART_SCHEMA.sql
-- This creates tables, functions, triggers, and RLS policies
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required. Uses existing Supabase configuration.

### Customization Options
- Default expiration: 7 days (configurable in ShareCartModal)
- Maximum expiration: 30 days
- Notification polling: 30 seconds
- Access count threshold for notifications: 5 views

## API Endpoints

The feature uses Supabase client-side API calls:

- `POST /rest/v1/shareable_carts` - Create shareable cart
- `GET /rest/v1/shareable_carts?share_token=eq.{token}` - Get cart by token
- `PATCH /rest/v1/shareable_carts?id=eq.{id}` - Update cart status
- `GET /rest/v1/shareable_cart_analytics` - Get analytics (admin)

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Expired Cart**: Shows "Cart Not Available" with expiration message
2. **Invalid Token**: Shows "Cart Not Available" with error message
3. **Paid Cart**: Prevents duplicate payments
4. **Network Errors**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback

### User Feedback
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Loading states during API calls
- Clear error messages
- Success confirmations

## Analytics & Tracking

### Metrics Tracked
- Cart creation count
- Access count per cart
- Payment completion rate
- Expiration rate
- User engagement

### Analytics View
- Daily statistics
- Revenue from shared carts
- Popular sharing patterns
