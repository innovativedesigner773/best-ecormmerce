# Stock Notification System - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Stock notifications not being sent to customers

### Root Cause
The automatic notification processing was not started when the app loads, so notifications were being queued but never processed.

### Solution Applied

1. **âœ… Fixed Automatic Processing**: Added automatic notification processing to the main App component that runs every 30 seconds
2. **âœ… Manual Processing Available**: Created a manual script to process pending notifications immediately
3. **âœ… Admin Dashboard Integration**: The StockNotificationManager is already available in the admin dashboard

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Processing
- **When**: Every 30 seconds automatically
- **What**: Processes up to 10 pending notifications at a time
- **Where**: Started in `src/App.tsx` when the app loads

### Manual Processing
- **Admin Dashboard**: Go to Admin â†’ Stock Notifications tab
- **Command Line**: Run `npm run process-notifications`
- **What**: Immediately processes all pending notifications

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Check if automatic processing is running
```bash
# Look for this in the browser console:
ðŸ”„ Starting automatic notification processing...
```

### 2. Test the notification flow
1. Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Stock Notifications tab
2. Check the queue status
3. If there are pending notifications, click "Process Queue"
4. Verify emails are sent

### 3. Manual processing (if needed)
```bash
# Run this command to immediately process pending notifications
npm run process-notifications
```

## Admin Dashboard Access

1. **Login as Admin**: Use an admin account
2. **Navigate**: Go to `/admin` 
3. **Stock Notifications Tab**: Click on the "Stock Notifications" tab
4. **Available Actions**:
   - View queue status
   - Process pending notifications manually
   - Retry failed notifications
   - Clear failed notifications
   - Test email functionality

## Database Tables Involved

- `stock_notifications`: Customer requests to be notified
- `notification_queue`: Queued notifications waiting to be sent
- `stock_notification_log`: Log of trigger activations

## Email Configuration

The system uses EmailJS with these templates:
- **Service ID**: `service_u25vulc`
- **Template ID**: `template_k3jvli8` (Stock notification template)
- **Public Key**: `4S229zBwfW7pedtoD`

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If notifications still aren't being sent:

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for these messages in browser console:
   ðŸ”„ Starting automatic notification processing...
   Processed X notifications: Y sent, Z failed
   ```

2. **Check Queue Status**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard â†’ Stock Notifications
   - Look at the queue statistics
   - If there are pending notifications, try manual processing

3. **Check EmailJS Configuration**:
   - Verify EmailJS service is active
   - Check template exists and is properly configured
   - Test with a single email first

4. **Check Database Triggers**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify the trigger exists
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name = 'stock_update_notification_trigger';
   ```

5. **Manual Processing**:
   ```bash
   npm run process-notifications
   ```

## Files Modified

- `src/App.tsx`: Added automatic processing startup
- `src/scripts/process-pending-notifications.js`: New manual processing script
- `package.json`: Added `process-notifications` script command

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the app** to activate automatic processing
2. **Test by updating stock** on a product with pending notifications
3. **Check admin dashboard** to verify notifications are being processed
4. **Monitor console logs** for processing activity

The system should now automatically send stock availability emails to customers within 30 seconds of stock being updated!
