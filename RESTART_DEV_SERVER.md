# 🔄 You Must Restart the Dev Server!

## The Issue
The `.env.local` file has been created successfully with your Stripe key, but **Vite only loads environment variables when it starts**. The server is currently running without the Stripe configuration.

## ✅ Solution - Follow These Steps:

### 1. Stop the Current Dev Server
In the terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server
- You might need to press it twice

### 2. Start the Dev Server Again
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access Your App
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/checkout`

## 🎯 What Should Happen:

**Before restart:**
- ❌ "Stripe Configuration Error" message
- ❌ No payment form visible

**After restart:**
- ✅ Stripe payment form appears
- ✅ Card input fields are visible
- ✅ You can enter test card details

## 💳 Test Card for Verification:
- Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
- CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)

## 🔍 Still Not Working?

If you still see the error after restarting:

1. **Verify the server restarted properly:**
   - The terminal should show: `VITE v5.x.x ready in xxx ms`
   - It should open at `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or open DevTools → Network tab → check "Disable cache"

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any error messages

## 📝 Why This Happens:

Vite (and most build tools) read environment variables only at startup. When you add or change `.env` files, you must restart the server for changes to take effect. This is a security feature to prevent runtime manipulation of environment variables.

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

Once you restart the server, your Stripe integration will be working! The payment form will appear and you can test the checkout process.
